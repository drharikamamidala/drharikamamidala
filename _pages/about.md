I’m `Harika Mamidala`, pursuing a Master of Science in Health Informatics at Sacred Heart University.

I specialize in `data analytics`, `EHR systems`, and `clinical decision support`.

I’m a `Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst (PL-300)` skilled in Power BI, SQL, and healthcare data visualization.

My current research compares `Natural Language Processing (NLP)` and `rule-based methods` for identifying Type 2 Diabetes from unstructured EHR notes.

I aim to apply data-driven methods to enhance clinical insights, operational efficiency, and patient outcomes.
